# Introduction

## Abstract

This project delves into the theoretical framework of two types of models. It aims to compare and contrast the performances of the moving average model and the artificial neural network on the prediction of stock market indices. We used the data collected from Yahoo Finance with daily frequency for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2021. By using a rolling window approach, we evaluated ARIMA-SGARCH to reflect the specific time-series characteristics and have better predictive power than the simple ARIMA model and Recurrent Neural Network models. In order to assess the precision and quality of these models in forecasting, we compared their equity lines, their forecasting error metrics and their performance metrics. The main contribution of this research is to show that the hybrid ARIMA SGARCH model outperforms the other models over the long term. 


## Importance of this topic

The importance of this topic can be condensed to 4 points:

-   **Interest in the area**: attracted attention of researchers, investors, speculators, and governments
-   **ARIMA hybrid over ARIMA**: financial time series often do not follow ARIMA assumptions
-   **newest ML techniques to improve models**: We use Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) model to determine if it can reflect the specific time series characteristics and predict better. 

# Methodology and Data

## Data Analysis

The first step in the process was cleaning the data. Then, we transformed the adjusted price into a daily logarithmic return, which was calculated according to the following formula:
$$
r_t = ln\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}
$$
Reasons to choose log returns:
-   can be added across time periods to create cumulative returns
-   easy to convert between log return and simple return
-   log return follows normal distribution 

Advantages to log return having normal distribution: 
-   Distribution only dependent on mean and sd of sample
-   forecast with higher accuracy (log return)
-   Stock prices cannot be normal distribution


## Descriptive Statistics - Stock prices

This presents the descriptive statistics of the adjusted closing prices

```

## Descriptive Statistics - Stock prices II 

There are a few periods, such as 2008, 2011, 2015, and 2018, that show high volatility of returns. We can expect to build more accurate forecasting models if we are able to mitigate and “smooth” such periods.

```

Stock prices of SP 500 are not normally distributed!

## Descriptive Statistics - Log Returns 

This presents the descriptive statistics of the adjusted closing prices

```

We use log returns to build models!



## Methodology - ARIMA (p,d,q)

The ARMA process is the combination of the autoregressive model and moving average designed for a stationary time series. 

Autoregression (AR) describes a stochastic process, and AR(p) can be denoted as shown below:
$$
  y_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y_{t - 1} + \phi_{2}y_{t - 2} + \cdots + \phi_{p}y_{t - p} + \varepsilon_{t},
$$
where $\varepsilon_{t}$ is white noise. This is a multiple regression with lagged values of $y_{t}$ as predictors.

The moving average process of order q is denoted as MA(q) and the created time series contains a mean of q lagged white noise variables shifting along the series.
$$
  y_{t} = c + \varepsilon_t + \theta_{1}\varepsilon_{t - 1} + \theta_{2}\varepsilon_{t - 2} + \cdots + \theta_{q}\varepsilon_{t - q},
$$
where $\varepsilon_{t}$ is white noise. This is a multiple regression with past errors as predictors.

## Methodology - ARIMA (p,d,q)

d is the number of differencing done to the series to achieve stationarity with I (d) so the ARIMA model can be expressed as 
$$\text{Expand:}\qquad
  y_t = c + y_{t-1} + \phi_1 y_{t-1}- \phi_1 y_{t-2} + \theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t
$$
p is the number of autoregressive terms (AR)
d is the number of differencing (I)
q is the number of moving average terms (MA)

## Methodology - ARCH(p)

The `ARCH(p)` model is given:
$$\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^{p}\alpha_{i}u^2_{t-i}$$

-   Most volatility models derive from this
-   Returns have a conditional distribution (here assumed to be normal)
-   ARCH is not a very good model and almost nobody uses it.
-   The reason is that it needs to use information from many days before $t$ to calculate volatility on day $t$. That is, it needs a lot of lags.
-   The solution is to write it as an ARMA model.
-   That is, add one component to the equation, $\beta\sigma_{t-1}$.

##  Methodology - GARCH(r,s) and Hybrid ARIMA-SGARCH

The `GARCH(p,q)` model is
$$\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \sum_{i=1}^{p}\alpha_{i}u^2_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{q}\beta_{j}\sigma^2_{t-j}$$
Where: $\alpha$ is news. $\beta$ is memory. The size of $(\alpha + \beta)$ determines how quickly the predictability of the process dies out.

This leads us to lastly, ARIMA-SGarch 


## ARIMA SGARCH - Overview

Stock prices can be tremendously volatile during economic growth as well as recessions. When homoskedasticity presumption is violated, it affects the validity or power of statistical tests when using ARIMA models. We consider the SGARCH effect. The error term of the ARIMA model in this process follows SGARCH(1,1) instead of being assumed constant like the ARIMA model.

## ARIMA SGARCH - Steps

1) We conduct a rolling forecast based on an ARIMA-SGARCH model with window size(s) equal to 1000. 

2) The optimized combination of p and q which has the lowest AIC is used to predict return for the next point. At the end, the vector of forecasted values has the length of 3530 elements

3) We describe and review our implementation of dynamic ARIMA(p,1,q)-SGARCH(1,1) models with GED distribution and window size(s) equal to 1000. 

4) we evaluate the results based on error metrics, performance metrics, and equity curves.
